## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This landing page was a good challenge, it helped me to consider mobile, tablet and desktop scenarios, both the issue of breakpoints to adapt the content and consequent changes to increase or decrease the size of the web.

### Continued development

I will continue to strive to make a much cleaner code, with good practices and more optimized to different devices. There will always be things to polish to get the best out of us as developers.
